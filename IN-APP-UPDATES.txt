- Octo can now automatically be sandboxed inside Docker containers with the
  `octo docker connect my-container-name` command!
- Octo can also launch Docker images and sandbox itself inside them with the
  `octo docker run -- <docker run args>` command. Octo will stop the image for
  you when you quit.
- UI improvements + bugfixes
