TODO:

- [ ] Situational awareness: if it's a git repo, check the gitignore, and get a
  bunch of the directory heirarchy into context space automatically.
- [ ] `mkdir -p` for file creation, don't fail if the dir doesn't exist

# Launch blocking
- [ ] Test the API connection in the add model flow, like you do in the NUX
- [ ] Bug: "impossible tool ordering" when a user rejects and swaps models
