TODO:

- [ ] Situational awareness: if it's a git repo, check the gitignore, and get a
  bunch of the directory heirarchy into context space automatically.
- [ ] `mkdir -p` for file creation, don't fail if the dir doesn't exist
- [ ] Better onboarding: auto-detect OpenAI, Synthetic, Grok keys and have
  streamlined setup for the add model flow for them.
- [ ] Support the Anthropic API
- [ ] Gemini support
